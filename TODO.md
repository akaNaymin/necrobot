# Necrobot TODO

Current version: 0.10

- Match type isn't being set from sheet correctly?
- Race rooms maybe should use RTMP names only
- Output text in channel on command throwing error if possible
- Empty matches breaking getting matches from sheet

## Automatching

- Auto-register users on match creation

## Ladderbot and Leagues

- Lots of things here
- Better rankings display
- Add match entrants to the `entrants` table in a league database

## Refactor

- `util.level.py` and `util.racetime.py` might work better as classes
- Replace NoneType returns with exceptions where appropriate
- Gather argument parsing code

### Cleaner lib classes

- combine MatchRaceData and Match in a friendly way
- better standings update code

### Testing

- Make more small/unit tests (may wish to use a mock DB and/or a mock discord client)

## Bugs

- `.d 2-3` responds with '<player> has forfeit the race' twice
- `.register-condor-event` should set correct views and so on
- Necrobot and Condorbot should not attempt to write to the same log file
- Cyber listed twice on `.fastest` (because times are identical)

### QoL UI Improvements

- Fix help text for `.make` and allow `--` prepended to command keywords
- Deal with duplicated Discord names in commands like `.add` (allow for discriminator)
- Deal with database out-of-date names in commands like `.add`
- Better timezone parsing
- More friendly parsing of spaces in command arguments

### Unclear issues

- `.forcecancel` doesn't seem to work as intended; racerooms can get stuck
- Various issues with raceroom topic not updating properly (e.g. on .r without .e)
- `.forcecancel` is kind of unintuitive when input pre-race, since it's not clear if you want to cancel the race
just finished or the race that people are currently entering. It maybe also doesn't work after a race?

### Things I don't understand

- manfred4 wasn't properly added to rooms on RTMP setting; traceback was:
  File "/home/bot/necrobot/necrobot/match/matchmgr.py", line 41, in ne_process
    overwrite=read_perms
  File "/home/bot/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/discord/client.py", line 3040, in edit_channel_permissions
    raise InvalidArgument('target parameter must be either Member or Role')
- Ri's timezone was getting read as none by bot but correctly used

## Features

- Configuration of `.racealert` for character-specific, etc
- Add more complicated sorts to `.mostraces`
- Add `.forceunready` command
- Raceroom-specific voice chat, with an audio countdown and some other audio support (e.g. "Please pause.").

### Different race modes

- Score
- Time limits, with an auto-ping when the time expires

### Stream support / Twitch integration

Allow for users to register their streams and to tag certain races as "streamed". For such races, generate 
a multitwitch or kadgar link upon asking. As an even bigger project, make the bot able to check whether said 
users are actually streaming. Also, make the bot able to report in your twitch chat when people in your race 
have finished or forfeit (and who won, etc.)

### Daily improvements

- A weekly that's intended for optimizing a seed.
- Make the daily more like an asynchronous race: You're allowed to die, and the bot tracks your time between a
`.begin` and `.done` sent via PM. (This could be made alongside an "individual run module" for practicing?)
